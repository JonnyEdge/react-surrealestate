# React Real Estate App

React real estate app. Renders property cards, lets a user filter by city and add new properties. Should only be used in conjunction with the API, which only exists locally for now.

## Features of Interest

* Single page application
* Client-side routing
* HTTP requests and API interaction
* OAuth

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start up the application:

```bash
npm start
```

### Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

Main Surreal navigation should load, but won't pull information, render cards or allow you to submit a new property without the API running in the background.
